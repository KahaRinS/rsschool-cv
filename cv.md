**ABOUT ME**

Hello! My name is Slava. Itâ€™s my first task from RSSchool.
And here a lot of information about me:

I have been studying algorithmization since I was two years old. However, like almost all people. But now the question of earning money has arisen, in connection with which there is a need to obtain an entry-level programmer certificate.

And so it happened that I am now writing this text in the VS code to pass the autotest.
